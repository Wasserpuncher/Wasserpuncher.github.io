### About me
I live in WÃ¼rzburg (Germany). 
I am interested in Python programming. 
I am relatively new to GitHub.
I have also programmed a few things on a Raspberrypi. 
So in the programming world I am not quite so inexperienced. 
In terms of Java or so I have no idea.

    I just realize that this page is totally unnecessary
    But I do it because I am interested in websites and programming.
    As I said mainly Python but also HTML
